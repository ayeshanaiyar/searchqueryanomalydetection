# searchqueryanomalydetection
# Overview
This project defines the  process of identifying unusual patterns or outliers in search query data that deviates significantly from the norm. 
# Prerequisties
1. Pip
2. Python
3. Jupyter notebook
# Libraries
1. Pandas
2. Matplotlib
3. Seaborn
4. Scikit-learn
# Dataset
The datasets contains
1. Top Queries: The actual search terms used by users.
2. Clicks: The number of times users clicked on the website after using the query.
3. Impressions: The number of times the website appeared in search results for the query.
4. CTR (Click Through Rate): The ratio of clicks to impressions, indicating the effectiveness of
 the query in leading users to the website.
5. Position: The average ranking of the website in search results for the query.
# Implementation
1. Gather historical search query data from the source.
2. Conduct an initial analysis to understand the distribution of search queries, their frequency, and any noticeable patterns or trends.
3. Create relevant features from the search query data that can aid in anomaly detection.
4. Choose a machine learning algorithms like Isolation Forests.
5. Train the model on the prepared data. Apply the trained model to the search query data to identify anomalies or outliers.
# purpose of anomalies
They are indicators of potential areas for growth, optimization, and strategic focus. These anomalies are reflecting emerging trends or areas of growing interest. Staying responsive to these trends will help in maintaining and growing the websiteâ€™s relevance and user engagement.
